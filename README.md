## Overview

This notebook implements a U-Net model for the segmentation of pneumothorax (collapsed lung) in chest X-ray images. The U-Net architecture is a common convolutional neural network model used for medical image segmentation tasks. This notebook is specifically designed to load, preprocess, train, validate, and evaluate a U-Net model on a dataset of X-ray images with pneumothorax masks.

## Contents

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**:
   - Connects to Google Drive to load zipped image datasets.
   - Unzips the data and organizes it into folders for training and testing.
   - Provides functionality to visualize training images and masks.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Defines the U-Net architecture using Keras and TensorFlow, with layers like `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `UpSampling2D`, `Concatenate`, and `BatchNormalization`.
   - Includes configuration for activation functions and dropout layers to enhance model robustness.

3. **Training and Callbacks**:
   - Sets up training parameters, including random seeds for reproducibility.
   - Configures callbacks like `ModelCheckpoint`, `ReduceLROnPlateau`, and `EarlyStopping` to optimize training.

4. **Evaluation and Prediction**:
   - Evaluates model performance on test data, displaying metrics such as accuracy and IoU (Intersection over Union).
   - Visualizes predicted segmentation masks alongside actual masks to compare performance.

## Usage

To use this notebook:

1. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `cv2`, `keras`, and `tensorflow` installed.
   - Mount your Google Drive if using Colab to access datasets.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Place the data zip file in your Google Drive and update paths as needed in the notebook.

3. **Run the Cells**:
   - Follow the cells sequentially to preprocess data, build and train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Notes

- The dataset must include images and corresponding segmentation masks organized into folders as specified in the notebook.
- Modify `TRAIN_SEED` and `VALIDATION_SEED` values if desired for reproducibility adjustments.
